# Semantic-Logo-Classifier
This is a repository containing the implementation and datasets of a Semantic Logo Classifier
It contains 2 folders:
1. One contains the resulting data from the lowercase input data passed through the 4 models
2. The other contains the resulting data from the raw input data passed through the 4 models

I have done both because I wanted to see how it affects the models' performance with and without changes to the original data.
However, the original data didn't contain any special characters or symbols; therefore, I have converted it to lowercase only for tuning the data
